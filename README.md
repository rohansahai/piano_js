================

A piano built in js

To run:

Download zip or clone in desktop and simply open the piano.html file in chrome (works best in chrome). 
There is also two different modes for interval training (easy and hard).

NOTE: I wrote this code while learning javascript (and programming in general), so I'm sorry in advance for the rookie code.
